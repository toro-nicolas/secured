## Description üìù
The **Organized** is a project carried out in **solo**, during our **1st year** in [**EPITECH**](https://www.epitech.eu/) Grand Ecole program.  
Its purpose is to create in [**C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) a **hash library** for securing data.  


## Usage ‚öîÔ∏è
To use this library, you need to include the **header file** in your project (hashtable.h) and compile your project with the **library** (libhashtable.a).  

If you want test the library, you edit the main functions of the file **main.c** and compile the project with this command :
```sh
make test
```
Then, you can run the test project like this :
```sh
./secured
```


## Result üö©
The result of this project is an **perfect Secured**.  
If you discover a **problem** or an **error**, don't hesitate to **create an issue** and **report it** to us as soon as possible.

### Tests and code coverage
**Unit tests** were performed using [criterion](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/intro.html).  
In this project, **only** the **library code is covered**.
Unit tests are still to be performed, but a large part of the code is already covered.

You can compile the project and run the unit tests with this command :
```sh
make tests_run
```


## Compilation üõ†Ô∏è
You can compile the project with this command :
```sh
make
```

If you want clean the project, you can run this command :
```sh
make fclean
```

You can clean and compile the project with ```make re```.

You can compile the unit tests with this command :
```sh
make unit_tests
```


## Code mandatory üì¶
- You'll need to create a branch where you'll push your code. Once you've completed your tasks on this branch, we'll work together to merge it and check that everything works.
- Every function you add must be code-style.
- Before merging, you'll need to check that all unit tests pass by running ```make tests_run```.
- Each commit will contain ```[+]``` or ```[-]``` or ```[~]``` followed by a message
    - ```[+]``` : Add feature
    - ```[-]``` : Delete feature
    - ```[~]``` : Edit feature

**Of course, in exceptional cases, we may depart from these rules.**


## What's next ? üöÄ
- Add help section
- Add github actions
- Improve the memory management
- Add a documentation for each function
- Add unit tests on each piece of code
- Add more hash algorithms
